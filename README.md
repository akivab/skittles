Skittles
========

Siyang, Ashish, Orestis, Akiva

For Monday
----------
Tasting:
  * Eat one of the worst thing we have

Create a vector of size for each player:
  * Amount offered
  * Amount requested

For making offers:
  * Look at profile of each player
  * Trade something positive for them for something negative for us;
    something positive for us for something negative for them.
  * Aggregate 1-to-1 trades that we like for each player

For taking offers (Orestis):
  * Add up the happiness for us per offer (blind to what we have)
  * Another evaluation is not blind. It's based on what you have.
  * Weighted function of the two.
